## Codebase Patterns
- Models use @Observable macro (iOS 17+) for reactive state
- Singletons follow pattern: `static let shared = ClassName()` with private init
- UserDefaults persistence with keys defined as private constants
- Views use SettingsManager.shared for accessing user preferences
- Audio uses AVAudioEngine with programmatic tone synthesis

### What was implemented
- Daily Challenge System with deterministic puzzle generation using date-based seed
- SeededRandomNumberGenerator struct for reproducible randomness
- Streak tracking with consecutive day detection
- Daily best times storage keyed by date string
- DailyChallengeView with special styling (accent color border)
- Countdown timer to next daily puzzle
- Special fanfare sound for daily completion

### Files changed
- zipswift/Models/DailyChallenge.swift (new)
- zipswift/Views/DailyChallengeView.swift (new)
- zipswift/Models/SettingsManager.swift (added daily streak, lastDailyDate, dailyBestTimes)
- zipswift/Views/GameView.swift (added Daily Challenge button with streak indicator)

### Learnings
- Used SeededRandomNumberGenerator with LCG algorithm for deterministic daily puzzles
- Streak logic: increment if last completion was yesterday, reset if not today
- Used .fullScreenCover for DailyChallengeView to make it feel like a special mode
- Reused ConfettiView from WinOverlayView for celebration
- Calendar.current.startOfDay(for:) for consistent date comparisons

### Learnings
- Used separate struct for Achievement and enum for AchievementDefinitions to separate data from definitions
- Track undoUsedThisGame state to detect perfectionist achievement
- Check hour with Calendar.current.component(.hour, from: Date()) for time-based achievements
- Session game count resets on app launch but persists during session
- Merge saved achievements with definitions to handle new achievements added later

- StarRatingView component with animated star appearance
- StarRating struct for calculating stars per difficulty
- Stars field added to GameRecord with auto-calculation
- Total stars tracking in GameHistoryManager

- zipswift/Models/GameRecord.swift (added stars field)
- zipswift/Models/GameHistoryManager.swift (added star statistics methods)
- zipswift/Audio/AudioManager.swift (added playThreeStarFanfare, playStarCompletionSound)

### Learnings
- Keep StarRating calculation in a reusable struct for consistency across views
- Added optional stars param to GameRecord init with auto-calculation fallback
- Use .spring() animation with delay for sequential star appearance
- Extended fanfare for 3-star uses higher notes (up to C7) for more celebratory effect

### What was implemented
- Level Pack system with 5 packs containing 10 handcrafted levels each
- LevelPack struct with id, name, description, levels, and requiredStars
- LevelProgressManager singleton for tracking completion and stars per level
- LevelPacksView showing pack grid with lock/unlock status and progress bars
- LevelSelectView showing 5-column grid of level buttons with star ratings
- Pack/level indicator shown during gameplay
- Grid button in GameView header for accessing level packs

### Files changed
- zipswift/Models/LevelPack.swift (new - LevelPack struct + LevelPacks with 5 packs)
- zipswift/Models/LevelProgressManager.swift (new - progress tracking singleton)
- zipswift/Views/LevelPacksView.swift (new - pack selection with LevelPackCard)
- zipswift/Views/LevelSelectView.swift (new - level selection with LevelButton)
- zipswift/Views/GameView.swift (added Level Packs button, sheet, loadPackLevel, pack indicator)

### Learnings
- Each handcrafted level needs valid Hamiltonian path (visits all 36 cells exactly once)
- Use GridPoint for coordinates, numberedCells maps GridPoint to Int for node placement
- Pack progress stored in UserDefaults with key format "packId_level_levelIndex"
- LevelPack already conforms to Identifiable in model - don't redeclare in view
- Progressive star requirements (0, 5, 20, 50, 100) create unlocking progression
- Show pack/level indicator only when playing pack level (currentPackId != nil)
- Clear pack tracking in generateNewGame() to distinguish random vs pack games

### What was implemented
- Share Results feature with shareable card image and text
- ShareCardView renders branded result card with accent color theming
- ShareHelper generates text summary and image using ImageRenderer
- Share button on WinOverlayView and DailyWinOverlayView
- ShareSheet wraps UIActivityViewController for iOS sharing
- Daily challenges show "Daily" badge and streak in share card
- Haptic feedback on share button tap

### Files changed
- zipswift/Views/ShareCardView.swift (new - ShareCardView and ShareHelper)
- zipswift/Views/WinOverlayView.swift (added Share button, ShareSheet, isDaily/dailyStreak params)
- zipswift/Views/DailyChallengeView.swift (added Share button to DailyWinOverlayView)

### Learnings
- ImageRenderer creates UIImage from SwiftUI views for sharing
- Use fixed scale (3.0) instead of deprecated UIScreen.main.scale
- ShareSheet wraps UIActivityViewController as UIViewControllerRepresentable
- Added optional isDaily and dailyStreak params with defaults to WinOverlayView
- Daily challenges use .medium difficulty for star calculation in share

### What was implemented
- Variable grid sizes (5×5, 6×6, 7×7, 8×8)
- GridSize enum with quick/classic/extended/marathon options
- Difficulty node counts adjusted per grid size
- Grid size picker in GameView header
- GridView dynamically renders any grid size
- defaultGridSize persisted in SettingsManager

### Files changed
- zipswift/Models/LevelGenerator.swift (added GridSize enum, nodeCount(for:) method)
- zipswift/Models/SettingsManager.swift (added defaultGridSize property)
- zipswift/Models/GameRecord.swift (removed redundant Codable extension)
- zipswift/Views/GameView.swift (added currentGridSize, grid size picker)
- zipswift/Views/GridView.swift (gridSize now uses gameState.level.size)

### Learnings
- LevelDefinition already supported variable size, just needed to expose it via UI
- GridView's gridSize was hardcoded to 6, made it a computed property from gameState
- Difficulty enum changed to String rawValue for simpler Codable conformance
- Node counts per grid size follow pattern: more nodes for larger grids to maintain guidance level

### What was implemented
- Challenge modes system with 4 different gameplay modes
- Time Attack: 60-second countdown, complete as many puzzles as possible

- zipswift/Views/ChallengeGameView.swift (new - gameplay for challenge modes)
- zipswift/Views/GameView.swift (added showChallengeModes, activeChallengeMode, bolt button)

### Learnings

- Speed Run compares by minimum time (lower is better)
- Zen mode shows leaf icon instead of timer for relaxed feel
- Time Attack countdown uses remainingTime, others use elapsedTime
- Challenge results stored with mode-specific scoring

### What was implemented
- Hint system with 3 hints per puzzle showing next cells in solution path
- getHintCells() method in GameState finds next unvisited cells from solutionPath
- HintIndicator view with pulsing animation and numbered order display

- zipswift/Views/GameView.swift (added hint state, button, activateHint function)
- zipswift/Views/StarRatingView.swift (added hintsUsed param to stars() method)

### Learnings
- Solution path stored in LevelDefinition makes hint system straightforward
- Find current position in solutionPath, return next N unvisited cells
- Pulsing animation uses repeatForever with autoreverses for smooth effect
- Stagger hint indicator animations with delay based on order
- Default parameter hintsUsed=0 preserves backward compatibility for existing callers
- Reset hints in both generateNewGame() and loadPackLevel() for consistency
